            PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an online multiplayer battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video game company Bluehole. The game is based on previous mods that were created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, inspired by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.

            Battlegrounds is a player versus player shooter game in which up to one hundred players fight in a battle royale, a type of large-scale last man standing deathmatch where players fight to remain the last alive. Players can choose to enter the match solo, duo, or with a small team of up to four people. The last person or team alive wins the match.<br> <br>
  
            Each match starts with players parachuting from a plane onto one of the four maps, with areas of approximately 8 × 8 kilometres (5.0 × 5.0 mi), 6 × 6 kilometres (3.7 × 3.7 mi), and 4 × 4 kilometres (2.5 × 2.5 mi) in size.[2] The plane's flight path across the map varies with each round, requiring players to quickly determine the best time to eject and parachute to the ground.[1] Players start with no gear beyond customized clothing selections which do not affect gameplay. Once they land, players can search buildings, ghost towns and other sites to find weapons, vehicles, armor, and other equipment. These items are procedurally distributed throughout the map at the start of a match, with certain high-risk zones typically having better equipment.[1] Killed players can be looted to acquire their gear as well.[1] Players can opt to play either from the first-person or third-person perspective, each having their own advantages and disadvantages in combat and situational awareness; though server-specific settings can be used to force all players into one perspective to eliminate some advantages.

            Erangel is the base map for the game. An 8x8 km map dotted with small outcroppings of buildings, the distance between major landmarks necessitates the use of vehicles to move between areas. As the game continues, the map area will be restricted to a smaller and smaller play area. A red circle will appear on the map from time to time, marking an area for offshore artillery to bombard. Erangel has varying weather, sometimes affecting visibility and requiring a change in tactics.<br><br>

            Cities and the local military base have plenty of decent loot, but you won't be the only one thinking the same thing. A mix of urban areas and wide open farmland create a wide variety of battles, ranging from intense close range firefights in streets and buildings, to long range sniping duels taking place across wheat fields.<br><br>

            The name Erangel was chosen, using PLAYERUNKNOWN's daughter's name, Eryn, as inspiration.

            Sanhok is the first map that the art team of PUBG Corp visited a location specifically for world art development. By physically being in the jungles and mountains in a humid Asian country, it not only made them imagine what the new map will play like, but they felt the breeze, smelled the air and heard the sounds. All of these experiences are helping the team create a unique map experience.
            <br><br>
            
            The map is inspired by a wide variety of islands in Thailand and the Philippines, the PUBG Art team; comprised of Technical Artists, Concept Artists and 3D Environment Artists, they took photos (Photogrammetry) to capture the island then transfer that to the game engine to design Sanhok [3].

            A powerful assault rifle that uses 7.62mm ammunition, this rifle does more damage than the 5.56mm assault rifles and comes with a kick to match. In regards to attachments, the AKM is identical to the M16A4 in that it can only accept a muzzle, magazine and sight attachment. It is best used in single-shot mode except when attempting to breach buildings with it. <br><br>

            At close to medium ranges, it is notable in that even if a target is wearing a military vest and/or Spetsnaz helmet, it only takes a maximum of five shots to kill. It is also capable of killing a Spetsnaz helmet wearer in two shots by landing a shot on the head, then finishing them off with another shot to any other part of their body.<br><br>

            The AKM will deal maximum damage within 50 meters, beyond that distance damage will continually decrease out to 290 meters. Thus, it is not recommended to engage sufficiently armored players at longer ranges as the recoil and lower bullet velocity compared to other rifles will prove landing consistent hits difficult.

            The Kar98k is highly sought after because of its ability to deal fatal damage against players wearing level 2 helmets, with only level 3 helmets able to protect their wearers from one shot kills assuming they are at more than 85% health. Because of this, it is a very good weapon for long-range engagements without having the risk of going to airdrops for the other bolt-action sniper rifles. Its main drawbacks are its slow reload time when reloading, with full reloads only being somewhat faster than reloading bullets individually, and its rather slow bullet velocity compensated with higher damage, making it more challenging to engage distant enemies, particularly if they are on the move.<br><br>

            The Kar98k will deal maximum damage out to 100 meters after which point damage will decrease, reaching its minimum at 485 meters.ure the island then transfer that to the game engine to design Sanhok [3].

            A motorcycle without a sidecar. It seats a driver and a passenger. Speed is the only protection it provides, outclassing all other vehicles in this aspect. Combined with its light weight, it is an extremely fuel efficient vehicle that can prove useful for much of the game.

            A 5-speed sedan, it has a higher top speed than the UAZ but at a cost of subpar off-road performance that becomes an issue over bumpy terrain. Care must be taken when driving at high speeds as it is liable to rollovers during hard cornering. The engine also does not have enough power to pull the vehicle up steep hills when stationary, so it is advisable that speed is maintained when driving up hills.<br><br>

            As with other vehicles, gas cans can be used while stationary to refuel, and a horn can be used to get the attention of teammates or anyone else within earshot of the horn. Cruising speed on a level surface tops out at around 105 km/h, however the engine can be boosted for a maximum speed of 131 km/h at the cost of increased fuel consumption. Like most other vehicles, the tires are vulnerable to gunfire and if destroyed, will reduce speed and handling performance.
